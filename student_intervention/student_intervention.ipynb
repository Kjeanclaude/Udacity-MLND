    "- Difference between Classification and Regression :\n",
    "  - **Regression learning** *has a continuous output (one real value)*. The output is the goal, the thing we try to find by the learning process. Regression could be represented by a linear model with this form : ax+b (where 'a' is the slope of the line and 'b', his intercept. For example, if we try to find the age of persons with their picture as input, the representation should be a linear model where each person (his picture could be represented on the graph abscisse by his name) will be mapped with the corresponding age (on the graph ordinate).\n",
    "  - **Classification learning** *has a binary or discrete output, {0, 1, ..., n}*. According to the type of problem to solve, these output could be given by labeled statements. For example if we have to determine if a person is a \"person of interest\", the output should be \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\".\n",
    "- **In our case**, the outputs (the values we try to find by this learning process) are discrete. Indeed, we try to determine if a student would fail according to some information on him as input, and provide assistance if the prediction is positive. So the output should be for example \"FAILURE\" or \"SUCCESS\". So, it is clear that we have here a **Classification learning problem**.\n"

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Here are the supervised learning models that, I think, are appropriate for this problem :\n",
    "- **The *\"Decision Tree\"* model**\n",
    "   - *What is it ?* : Decision Tree is a ***non-parametric*** supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It is used to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. The rules are simple conditional statements (for example, if-then-else decision rules). \n",
    "     \n",
    "   - *Strengths* : \n",
    "     - Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "     - Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed.\n",
    "     - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable.\n",
    "     - Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.\n",
    "     - Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "   - *Weaknesses* : \n",
    "     - Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. However it is possible to use the pruning method (prune the tree or ensemble many trees in a random forest ) to remove nodes that do not provide additional information. Pruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.\n",
    "     - Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.\n",
    "     - There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "     - Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.\n",
    "   - *Why is it appropriate for this problem ?* : \n",
    "     - It is appropriate for our current problem because we are in a case of classification supervised learning. We learn from an existing sample data that already contains inputs and ouputs values. And we want to predict the value of a target variable which determine if a student passed or not. So as it does, Decision Tree will help us predict the value of our target variable. Moreover the Decision Tree model requires little data preparation, and is simple to understand and to interpret. So it will allow us to work more easily on our data. In addition, we could generate understandable graphs, and with methods like *export_graphviz* we could visualize trees with their nodes (attributes) and parameter's values.\n",
    "- **The *\"Support Vector Machine (SVM)\"* model**\n",
    "   - *What is it ?* : Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.   \n",
    "   - *Strengths* : \n",
    "     - Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "     - Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "     - Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "     - Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *Weaknesses* : \n",
    "     - As any other classification algorithm, if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "     - SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "   - *Why is it appropriate for this problem ?* : \n",
    "     - It is appropriate for our current problem because we are in a case of classification supervised learning. Moreover with SVM we could easily detect outliers values. For example we can easily detect students with abnormal parameters value (very low or very high). On another hand, we have about 50 features and because SVM is effective in high dimensional spaces, we are sure to have reliable estimations.\n",
    "- **The *\"Naive Bayes\"* model**\n",
    "   - *What is it ?* : Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. More clearly, Naive Bayes  algorithms apply Bayes's probabilistic conditionnal independance on the features to give some predictions on data, as if there was an independence between every pair of features. It is used to solve classification problems.\n",
    "To perform his goal Naive Bayes uses several classifiers according to the cases :\n",
    "       - *GaussianNB* : implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian.\n",
    "       - *MultinomialNB* : implements the naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes variants used in text classification\n",
    "       - *BernoulliNB* : implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable.\n",
    "       - *Out-of-core naive Bayes model fitting* : Naive Bayes models can be used to tackle large scale classification problems for which the full training set might not fit in memory. To handle this case, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, and GaussianNB expose a partial_fit method that can be used incrementally.\n",
    "   - *Strengths* : \n",
    "      - Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods\n",
    "      - Each feature distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution (this helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality).\n",
    "      - Inference is cheap (simplicity).\n",
    "      - Uses few parameters (no hyper-parameters).\n",
    "      - Estimate parameters with labeled data.\n",
    "   - *Weaknesses* : \n",
    "      - It is a bad estimator. So the probability outputs from *predict_proba* are not to be taken too seriously. The model is likely to correctly assign the highest probability to the most likely class but this probability is unlikely to be accurate. This is why it is highly recommended to always work with optimal parameters with Naive Bayes.\n",
    "   - *Why is it appropriate for this problem ?* : \n",
    "     - It is appropriate for our current problem because we are in a case of classification supervised learning. Moreover with Naive Bayes methods we could easily evaluate each feature separetly as if we was in a one dimension case, using classifier's attributes like *theta_* (to know the mean of each feature per class) and *sigma_* (variance of each feature per class). So it will be very useful if we want more information about a particular feature. Another important reason is that, as we know that Naive Bayes learners and classifiers are easy and cheap to train (extremely fast), we could use them based on their low requirement of computational resources. Naive Bayes can run easily and fastly on any kind of computer."

    "\n",
    "*** Times Performance analysis ***\n",
    "- All the models (DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM and GaussianNB) have approximatively a zero (0.0000 s) prediction time.\n",
    "- We also see that for DecisionTreeClassifier and GaussianNB, their training time turns arround to zero (0.0000 s) when the training set size increase. This means that if we use them on a big data set they will train all the data fastly.\n",
    "- But the training time of the SVM classifier (SVC) increases with the quantity of data. Therefore, it grows slowly when the data increases. From a data set of 200 students to 300 students, we note a variation of about 2.17 % on the training time (mean value of several measurements).\n",
    "For a data set of 300 students, the training time is about 0.047 s. This implies that , on this basis, we need about two seconds to train a data set of 10,000 students (with Scikit learn, SVM can only handle roughly up to 10,000 samples), and we need 156 to 200 seconds (about 3 minutes) to train a data set of one million students (to reach this level we should train a SVM online with Pegasos or other stochastic gradient decent algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Scores Performance analysis ***\n",
    "- The Decision Tree algorithm produces the worst score performances. There is an important gap between the training and test scores (arround 0.3), even when the data increases. This is a sign of high variance and could lead to overfitting. So, with its actual parameters, this model will not well generalizes to unseen data. It should need more tunning process for improvement. \n",
    "- SVM and GaussianNB give the best score performances. For the both, the training and test scores are good and closer when the data increases (the gap is less than 0.1). And their scores seem to converge to a constant value when the data increases (arround 0.8).\n",
    "But the SVM algorithm produces the highest training and test scores, compared to the GaussianNB.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Final proposal ***\n",
    "- According to the times and scores analysis above, I recommend to choose the SVM algorithm as it is the the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance. Indeed, even if SVM has a slow training time compared to others, the rate of 3 minutes to train a data set of one million students is very acceptable. Generally, schools have more less students a year than this number, so the training time should be less in reality. Another possibility is that, as the SVM algorithm must hold the entire training set in memory during the training process, increase the memory capacity of the computer should also reduce considerably the training time. And ***once the data are trained, all the predictions are done very fastly***. Moreover, the essential thing is that ***SVM already produces the best scores for training and test data. So it is already ready to well generalizes to unseen data, and give reliable prediction on the plausible failure or success of a given student***. This is a sign of the fact that SVM naturally support well the structure of the data. We have just to tune it again to improve more its performance. We also know that Naive Bayes has the weakness to be a bad estimator, so I definitely propose SVM. After this, the other option should be the tuning of the Decision Tree model."

    "- The SVM algorithm will be implemented in a file to produce the prediction. First we will take the raw students data and fill it in the program file. Then the data will be reorganized into two types : the feature data and the target data. The feature data will contain all information about the caracteristics of the students. And the target data will contain the information about what we want to predict (the failure or success of a given student).\n",
    "From these two prepared types of data we will generate suitable data sets that can be fitted in the SVM algorithm for test and prediction implementation. Only the prepared data sets could be used to make prediction.\n",
    "- From the prepared data sets we will test the SVM prediction scores according to its own parameters until to find the best parameters that produces the best scores. The best scores determine that the model will well generalizes to unseen data after the final implementation. So how does SVM work ? It will separe the data into two classes according to the data points caracteristics : the students who have succeeded and those who have failed. And so it will finally define a margin, the maximal distance between the two classes. Then, the SVM will determine a line in the margin center as a decision boundary. All the data point on the side of the plan where the failure class is will be considered as a failure, and those on the other side of the plan will be considered as a success.\n",
    "And to well perform theses operations, the SVM need to be runned with the best parameters we mentionned previously.Once we have theses best parameters for SVM, we will implement the final version with them. So when the file will be applied to unseen data, it will automatically make reliable prediction about the students results, according to the information in the data. The program file execution will generate the expected information about students: their plausible failure or success."

    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
    " - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
